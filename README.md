# Langchain-Langgraph Workshop


This workshop guides you through the fundamentals of Langchain and Langgraph for creating robust LLM powered applications.

## Key Topics Covered
*   **Langchain Fundamentals**: Learn the core components of Langchain, including Chains, Agents, and Tools.
*   **Langgraph Fundamentals**: Understand how to build cyclical graphs and manage state for more complex AI applications.
*   **Langchain Create_Agent & Middleware**: Deep dive into creating intelligent agents that can reason and interact with their environment.

## Prerequisites
